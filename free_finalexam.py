# Final Exam Advanced Program
# Requirements:
# This program is based on a dice game.  It is played with 3 dice and each player has 3 tokens â€¦
#   typically quarters or dollars. The minimum number of players required to play  is 3.
#   You should program it to accept 3 â€“ 6 players.
# The roll:  You may only roll as many dice as you have tokens, up to a maximum of 3 dice.
#   If you have 3 or more tokens, you must roll 3 dice. If you have 2 tokens, you must roll 2 dice.
#   If you have 1 token, you must roll one die.  If you have no tokens, you are skipped for that turn,
#   but you are still in the game because some one may give one of their tokens to you  on their roll.
# The play:  Player rolls as many dice as they are entitled to.
# â€¢	For each 1 that is rolled, (L) the player gives one of their tokens to the player to their left.
# â€¢	For each 3 that is rolled, (R) the player gives one of their tokens to the player to their right
# â€¢	For each 5 that is rolled, (C) the player gives one of their tokens to the center of the table
# â€¢	For each even number that is rolled, (DOT) the player gets to keep a token
# Play continues around the table with each person rolling the number of dice they are entitled to roll.
# During the play tokens frequently change hands  and occasionally end up in the center resulting in there
#   being fewer and fewer tokens in the hands of the players.
# End of Game:  When only one player is left with at least 1 token, and no other players have any tokens,
#   the player with the token wins all of the tokens in the center.
#
# Your game must mimic this one with the exception that the rolls will be handled using the random library.
# It should accommodate from 3 to 6 people and the output should contain all information shown in the sample
#   output at the bottom of this file.  (The numbers and winners will not be the same, but the information
#   displayed on each player's turn should be based on the sample output.)
#
# Technical Requirements and Associated Grading:  Total of 300 points
# â€¢	40 points: Include a design diagram that:
# o	Has enough information in it that I can predict what your code structure will be
# o	Is NOT a copy of your code pasted into a chart
# â€¢	80 points: You must use parallel arrays to hold the following information and to control the play of the game:
# o	20 points: Player Names
# o	20 points: Player Tokens
# o	20 points: The Player to the current player's Left
# o	20 points: The Player to the current player's Right
# â€¢	50 points: Do not use any list functions, simply access the array values using subscripts
# â€¢	20 points: You must use Random and random.randint to generate the dice values each turn.
# â€¢	10 points: You must use loops and decision statements to play through the game;
# â€¢	20 points: You must use at least 2 functions besides main
# â€¢	30 points: Appropriate comments
# â€¢	50 points: Runs correctly with no errors or bugs
# â€¢	Unless you have spoken to me ahead of time, I want you to follow standard coding practices,
#       not the super-duper python practices.  For those of you that have been using the book
#       instead of my lectures, I will allow you some leeway, but you must discuss it with me
#       by Friday, Dec. 4nd by the latest.
#
# Stuff you need to know:
# â€¢	After Friday, Dec. 4, at 5:30, you can turn your file containing your design, code, and
#       output screens into the regular Final Programming Exam drop box.  I'm pretty sure it
#       will be obvious when I look at your code which direction you decided to take. ðŸ˜Š
# â€¢	You have until Saturday, Dec 5 to let me know if you plan to take the advanced program exam.
#       That should give you enough time to play with the program and have a good idea of whether
#       you want to try it.
# â€¢	My guess is that it will take you 10 â€“ 40 hours to complete based on how much prior
#       programming experience you have.
# â€¢	If after you give it a try, you decide to take the programming exam that the rest of
#       the class is taking along with the final exam quiz â€¦ you may take the regular
#       programming exam by Sunday, 11:30 PM to avoid a late penalty.
# â€¢	I suggest you play the game a few times "for real" before trying to program it.
# â€¢	Then I suggest you play the game and follow the movement of the tokens using "arrays" on paper.
